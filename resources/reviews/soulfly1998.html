    <p>Self-titled Soulfly I is one of my favourite albums</p>

    <p>Soulfly is the debut album by American metal band Soulfly, released on April 21, 1998 through Roadrunner Records. <br />
        The record was released in memory of frontman Max Cavalera's deceased stepson and was the first album featuring Cavalera since leaving Sepultura two years prior. <br />
        Both CDs have the message In Loving Memory Dana printed across them. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA.</p>
